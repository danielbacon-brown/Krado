# Krado
Krado is a full-featured RCWA simulator library.  The geometry of your device is easy to define and to visualize.  Refractive index data can be imported directly from the [RefractiveIndex.info database](https://refractiveindex.info/), from your own tabulated data, or from user-defined analytical functions.  It's designed to easy for a beginning user, but with detailed controls for advanced users.

Currently, the software is usable.  However, work to complete the manual, improve performance, ease-of-use, flexibility, etc. remains.
