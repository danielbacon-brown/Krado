Krado design (Krado is esparanto for lattice)

Want to mostly have a data pipeline style calculation.

An ExperimentSet defines how the simulations should be set up.  Conducts a sweep of experiments and analyzes them (e.g. wavelength sweep and )

An Experiment is a class that contains all data needed for doing a complete calculation of a single lattice, and contains the "raw" final data as well as some calculated data.

Experiment contains a Stack, an OrderSet, Planewave Array (incident), and Planewave Array (output)

A Stack contains an Array of Layers and a Periodicity.

A Convolution contains an Array of ConvolutionLayers.  A Stack is converted into a FourierStack, or modified individually by a

An Orderset contains an Array of Orders to be used in the calculation.

A Periodicity contains two Vectors of length 2.

A Planewave contains k-Vector, and a complex electric field Vector.  Do I want multiple ways of describing the electric field vector?  (e.g. x,y,z vs s,p)

A Layer defines the geometry and refractive index of a single layer.

A ConvolutionLayer defines convolution of a layer.
