TODO LIST:

TODO: Make a patterned layer act like an uniform layer if there is no variation in the film.

TODO: Turn scattering matrix into a parametric type that can handle DistributedArrays, etc.

TODO: Check to see if a inner conversion of TU2VectorInt -> T2VectorI just compiles away.  If so, just use that instead of another function.  It does compile away, so I should do that.

TODO: Remove unnecessary type definitions.

TODO: make MaterialDatabase (and Wavenumber etc) its own project?


TODO: Define "export" structs and functions

TODO: Finish sweep tests

TODO: Make Examples for folder. Start with just copied tests. Setup to just include or import Krado

TODO: Set up auto-documentation.  Add docs for user-adjacent functions.  Add docs for other functions. STARTED.

TODO: Split up "Miscellaneous" into smaller files with better names.

TODO: calculation of full kXYZset for a given layer

TODO: Remove individual calcϵ or calcμ and replace with getting calcϵμ[EPSILON], calcϵμ[MU]

TODO: Calculate the W₀ and V₀ only once! And what about Kx, Ky?
TODO: Use the preallocated matrix data in scattering matrix calculation
TODO: Use in-place operations in scattering matrix calculation

TODO: Use @inbounds in scattering matrix calcs
TODO: Use adjustable types in FreeSpaceParameters


TODO: Calculation of fields inside of a patterned layer
TODO: Functions for making tapers, turning a 3D function into a stack of layers, etc.
TODO: Nested sweeps
TODO: Plotting of results, e.g. transmission spectra

DONE: Variable precision in scattering matrices
TODO: Include more function-derived materials
TODO: Add user-set rules for material extrapolations

TODO: Measure and improve performance



TODO: RunSimulation for calculating Es and Ep transmission/reflection
TODO: RunSimulation for calculating Jones Matrix

TODO: Remove harmonics set from g-vectors
TODO: Use built-in Fourier transform method, FFT
TODO: Use analytical Fourier transform method

TODO: AnalysisDefinition for Tp, Ts, Rp, Rs
TODO: AnalysisDefinition for Jones Matrix T and R

TODO: import and export of Simulation and results data to YAML file
        - also for sweeps.

TODO: function defined shapes -- a shape with a lambda function check for is in x-y
TODO: define 3D shapes - to automatically create layers for complex 3F geometries (Or maybe a recursive type scattering matrix calculations?)

DONE: plotting of epsilon cross-section


DONE: Move Material database and user to tests to an external file.
DONE: change TU2VectorReal to Real2Vector? etc
DONE: replace positionListXY vector with it's own type
DONE: Plotting of refractive index cross-section
DONE: MAKE SURE IT WORKS WITH ABSORPTIVE MATERIALS
DONE: user favorite materials: a dict of function calls to import materials with a single name reference
        -- a function that will try to grab the materialnames used in the layerstack
DONE: add offset of lattice unit cell (to Lattice?) and grid positions
DONE: Add wavelength limits to materials
DONE: MAKE THIS WORK WITH DIAGONALS:
function calcWᵢλᵢ(Ω²ᵢ::Array{ComplexF64, 2})  --ScatteringMatrixCalculations
DONE: Replace stackedFieldsData2joinedFieldsData with FieldSetStackToXYZ - this might even be used
DONE: Loading Permittivity and Permeability data from a database
DONE: rename calcMagneticEigenvectorsFromQWλ to mention magnetic eigenvectors
DONE: Plotting of geometry and fields
        -including quivers for AOI, etc.
DONE: Forget the InputByBoundaryDefinition from mode altogether?
